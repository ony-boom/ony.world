I've always liked being in control of my music, I mean not using thrid party services to play/listen to my music.

I don't know, there's some aesthetic with having a walkman or IPOD, I've always wanted to have one them but I could'nt afford.

Since then, I was obssesd with music player.

I used Windows before and on windows there's [musicbee](https://getmusicbee.com/), and dang I love it, it have everything.

But windows as OS... Meh, for me at least it's so bad, I hate windows. Then I switched to linux and I don't regret it but yes, yes, musicbee is not supported on linux.

## Why not make one
