**MMS** (My Music Server), as the name imply is a simple music server.
I made it because there are any music player that actually fits my need.
It's not the best, but it's mine and works well for me. 

To put it simple, I wanted to have all of my music in the same place.
Yes, yes, yes... I know Spotify,Deezer,Tidal and so on exist but I don't want that... okay!
I'm a dev and I, instead of just using them, created my own.

I learned a lot making it and I don't regret. Sure there's a lot to improve and some of my choices when making it was wrong. For example I load all songs at the start and store them all inside `indexDB` (don't judge 😒, I know it's bad).
