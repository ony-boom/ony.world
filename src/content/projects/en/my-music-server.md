**MMS** (My Music Server), as the name implies, is a simple music server.

I've **always been a purist about my music collection**. Since I was a kid, I've kept my music as MP3 files on an SD card. I don't know, there's something about owning your music files that makes you feel closer to the artists and albums you love. 

But here's the problem: I have multiple devices. My phone, my desktop, maybe a laptop. Manually syncing music files across all of them? Absolute pain.

When I got my first VPS and discovered self-hosting, I found the solution. I tried Plex, Subsonic, Navidrome... they all worked well, and honestly, they're solid projects. But I wanted more - a specific vision I had in mind.

See, I'd been using [Otto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.piyush.music&hl=en&pli=1) on Android for years. It's a music player that just gets it - clean, intuitive, beautiful. I kept thinking: what if I could have that experience, but accessible from anywhere, on any device, through a web browser?

So I built it. **MMS**.
